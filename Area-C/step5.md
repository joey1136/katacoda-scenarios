In the last step, we have learnt different log table stored in the Mysql database.
In this step, we will learn how to create dashboard in Grafana using those log data.

# Introduction to Grafana Dashboard & Panel

In the Grafana, you can create a new dashboard in the left navigation bar or on main page.

![dashboard_1](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/main_dashboard.png?raw=true)

In your dashboard, you can create a panel or a row.

![dashboard_2](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/dashboard_1.PNG?raw=true)

You may also change the time interval of the log data such as Last 5 minutes, Last 15 minutes after creating the panels.

![dashboard_time](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/dashboard_time%20range.PNG?raw=true)

You may also export your dashboard into JSON format clicking the share button in the top of the dashboard.

![dashboard_export](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/dashboard_export.PNG?raw=true)

If you select "Add an empty Panel"
You will be redirect to a edit page.

![dashboard_3](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/panel_1.PNG?raw=true)

There is six main session in this page you need to know:

* `visualized panel (lime)` - this is the review of your panel, you may change it into table view to check whether what data you get from the query.
* `panel type (green)` - you can select the type of this panel. 
* `Control panel (yellow)` - you may select Query, Transform, Alert in this panel.
* `Datasource (pink)` - you may change the datasource of you query. In our case, we have two main datasource which is Mysql and Wordpress Database.
![dashboard_4](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/fail_choose%20datasource.PNG?raw=true)
* `Query Session (red)` - you may change your query in this session, you can click "Edit SQL" and change it into a sql input.
* `Panel Option (skyblue)` - you may change the detail of your panel in this session, for example Panel title, axis name, etc..


# Example on creating user failed login time series graph (Scenario 1)

Grafana's panel can centralized and visualized your log data in a human-friendly way.
This example will teach you how to create a time series graph.
You may go back to step4 - Scenario 1 to have a look on the example log in the log table.

In our "Query Session", we can insert our query and check the query output in "visualized panel".

In the time series panel, it need a time and a number of record in that time.
Our SQL statement is like this
SELECT <br />
  $__timeGroupAlias(date,1m), <br />
  count(*) AS "number" <br />
FROM wp_simple_history <br />
WHERE <br />
  $__timeFilter(date) <br />
AND message LIKE 'Failed to login%' <br /> 
GROUP BY 1 <br />
ORDER BY $__timeGroup(date,1m)


* `$__timeGroupAlias(date,1m)` - it use the 'date' column in the table and separate it into 1 minutes interval, you may change the time interval such as 1h.
* `count(*) AS 'number'` - it count the number of row which fulfill the query.
* `FROM wp_simple_history` - it state the table "wp_simple_history" of the query.
* `AND message LIKE "Failed to login%"` - it is a statement state that we only want to query log if it is login failed.
* `ORDER BY $__timeGroup(date,1m)` - you should also change the last line if you want to change the time interval in the second line.
`Note: Other query setting in this statement expect the above five cannot changed due to the panel setting, otherwize the panel will not show correctly.`

if `Data does not have a time field` is displayed, you may have no data fulfilling your query. Please check by query it in mysql container.

# Example on creating log count by ip bar chart (Scenario 2)

This example will teach you how to create a bar chart.

In the bar chart, it need a specific name and a number of record of that specific name.
Our SQL statement is like this

SELECT <br />
  l1.value, <br />
  count(*) as "number" <br />
from (wordpress.wp_simple_history_contexts l1 INNER JOIN wordpress.wp_simple_history l2 ON l1.history_id = l2.id) <br />
WHERE $__timeFilter(l2.date) <br />
AND l1.key = "_server_remote_addr" <br />
GROUP BY l1.value <br />
ORDER BY count(*) desc;


Explaination on the SQL statement:
* we have two table which is wp_simple_history_contexts and wp_simple_history, we name it as l1 and l2.
* we would like to use the inner join statement to join two table together, the joined table would like this:
![graph2_1](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/ip_graph.PNG?raw=true)

If you want to create another Bar chart, you must need the following:
SELECT <br />
  "name" <br />
  count(*) as "number" <br />
From "TABLE" <br />
WHERE $__timeFilter("your time column") <br />
GROUP BY "name" <br />
ORDER BY count(*) desc; <br />


Exercies: you may try to create another two scenario into panel.

Also, It is also a must configuration for bar chart:
you have to change format from timeseries to table in the query input part.

![graph2_2](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/ip_graph_table.PNG?raw=true)

The output of the graph will be like this:

![graph2_3](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-C/images/step5/ip_graph_innerjoin.PNG?raw=true)

Congulations! you have basic knowlege on how to create a dashboard and different panels to prevent missue/attacks/threats scenarios.
