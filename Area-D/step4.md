GDPR gives individuals the right to restrict the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances. This means that an individual can limit the way that an organisation uses their data. This is an alternative to requesting the erasure of their data.

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
- the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
- the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;
- the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

## Consent management
Consent management is the act or process of managing consents from your users and customers for processing their personal data.

A proper consent management system encompasses the following:
- Asking for consent by clearly disclosing what the consent is being given to and how the data will be used.
- Holding back all tracking until proper consent has been given.
- Securely storing all consents as documentation that the consent has been obtained.
- Giving your users access to withdraw their consent at any time.
- Consent must be renewed annually. However, some national data protection guidelines recommend more frequent renewal, e.g. 6 months. Check your local data protection guidelines for compliance
