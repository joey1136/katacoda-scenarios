## Consent management
Consent management is the act or process of managing consents from your users and customers for processing their personal data.

A proper consent management system encompasses the following:
- Asking for consent by clearly disclosing what the consent is being given to and how the data will be used.
- Holding back all tracking until proper consent has been given.
- Securely storing all consents as documentation that the consent has been obtained.
- Giving your users access to withdraw their consent at any time.
- Consent must be renewed annually. However, some national data protection guidelines recommend more frequent renewal, e.g. 6 months. Check your local data protection guidelines for compliance
