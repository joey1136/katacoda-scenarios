Individuals have the right to have personal data erased. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. The right only applies to data held at the time the request is received. It does not apply to data that may be created in the future. The right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances.

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:
- the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;
- the personal data have been unlawfully processed;
- the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject;

## Erasing the data of a user
Just like the data access request, a user can ask you to delete their data.

Navigate to `Tools > Erase Personal Data`.

To send the request, type their email address in the box provided and hit “Send Request.” They’ll receive an email with a confirmation link, which they’ll use to confirm the request. While you’re waiting for the customer to confirm, you’ll see the request displayed as “Pending.” Once they click the link, the status switches to “Confirmed”. The right of access is then granted to the person.
