The right of access plays a central role in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It allows the data subject to exercise further rights, which some of them will be mentioned later. An omitted or incomplete disclosure is subject to fines.

The answer to a right of access request includes two stages. First, the controller must check whether any personal data of the person seeking information is being processed at all. In any case, one must report a positive or negative result. If the answer should be positive, the second stage involves a whole range of information. 

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:
- the purposes of the processing;
- the categories of personal data concerned;
- the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;
- where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
- the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;
the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
- where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
- the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

## Accessing Personal Data
According to the GDPR, your users can demand access to their information stored in your server. It is important to be able to retrieve these data, when you receive a request from a user. 

When The First Request Comes In, confirm the identity of the person making the request before you export their personal data.  WordPress has a new page under `Tools > Export Personal Data` where you can send a confirmation request to the customer’s email address (or via their username, if they’re a registered user on the site):

![Confirm_Identity](https://github.com/joey1136/katacoda-scenarios/blob/main/Area-D/images/step1/ConfirmIdentity.png?raw=true)

To send the request, type their email address in the box provided and hit “Send Request.”  They’ll receive an email with a confirmation link, which they’ll use to confirm the request. While you’re waiting for the customer to confirm, you’ll see the request displayed as “Pending.” Once they click the link, the status switches to “Confirmed”. The right of access is then granted to the person.
