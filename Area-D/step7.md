## Automated individual decision-making 

Automated individual decision-making is a decision made by automated means without any human involvement.

Examples of this include:

- an online decision to award a loan; and
- a recruitment aptitude test which uses pre-programmed algorithms and criteria.

Automated individual decision-making does not have to involve profiling, although it often will do.

## Profiling

Organisations obtain personal information about individuals from a variety of different sources. Internet searches, buying habits, lifestyle and behaviour data gathered from mobile phones, social networks, video surveillance systems and the Internet of Things are examples of the types of data organisations might collect.

Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.

Organisations use profiling to:

- find something out about individuals’ preferences;
- predict their behaviour; and/or
- make decisions about them.

This can be very useful for organisations and individuals in many sectors, including healthcare, education, financial services and marketing.

Automated individual decision-making and profiling can lead to quicker and more consistent decisions. But if they are used irresponsibly there are significant risks for individuals. The UK GDPR provisions are designed to address these risks.

## Right not to be subject to automated decision-making

Individuals have the right not to be subject to a decision when:

- it is based on automated processing; and
- it produces an adverse legal effect or significantly affects the individual.

You must ensure that individuals are able to:
- obtain human intervention;
- express their point of view; and
- obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it.

To qualify as human intervention, you must ensure that you carefully analyse the decision and consider all the available input and output data, rather than just a token review. This should be carried out by someone who has the authority and competence to change the decision.

The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.
