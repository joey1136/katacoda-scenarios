Individuals have the right not to be subject to a decision when:

- it is based on automated processing; and
- it produces an adverse legal effect or significantly affects the individual.

You must ensure that individuals are able to:
- obtain human intervention;
- express their point of view; and
- obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it.

To qualify as human intervention, you must ensure that you carefully analyse the decision and consider all the available input and output data, rather than just a token review. This should be carried out by someone who has the authority and competence to change the decision.

The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.
