# Internal attack


An internal attack occurs when an individual or a group within an organization seeks to disrupt operations or exploit organizational assets. In many cases, the attacker employs a significant amount of resources, tools and skill to launch a sophisticated computer attack and potentially remove any evidence of that attack as well.

Highly-skilled and disgruntled employees (such as system administrators and programmers) or technical users who could benefit from disrupting operations may choose to initiate an internal attack against a company through its computer systems.
